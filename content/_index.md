# ðŸŒ± Thien Vu's Garden
210903 Fri

This is my simple [digital garden](digitalgarden.md). The ideas here are half-formed and scattered. They are not meant to be my definitive opinions. But some documented conversations with myself.

## Why public?
 Aren't notes private? They are, in the sense that these notes meant solely *for* **me**. I try not to concern myself with whether you will understand these notes (except this page, where I try to address confused wanderers).
 
 So why publish these notes at all?
 
 Taking notes has always been my tool to formulate my point of views, and to make sense of the world. In recent years, I've been questioning *why* this activity has to be private. One reason is I'm an academic; I have seen first-hand that one discussion of a half-formed idea with my colleagues allows the idea to blossom more than I could ever do on my own. Another reason is I've been thinking about *resisting* the impulse to manage my *online presence*. Many things online seem well- manicured. I developed this strange anxiety of presenting myself in the *best, most pefect* way. Publishing these notes is an experiment to show myself that the online construct can be mediocre, half-formed but evolving, and imperfect as I truly am.
 
 More practical other reasons to publish my personal notes:
 
1. I hope published notes will invite conversations that will expand and challenge me. So I can grow with these notes.
2. A challenge to myself to share my thoughts without concerning myself of the *performative* aspects of publishing (eg. weblogs).
3. I want to access my notes and thoughts from anywhere (eg. in conversation with a friend, I want to revisit to my thoughts on nuclear power last year).
4. If I get famous, this collection will help my autobiographer(s).


## Tools
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes.
I use [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz), a really nice set of tools to help me push my notes online without thinking.
